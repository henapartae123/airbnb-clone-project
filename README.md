# airbnb-clone-project.

## About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Team Roles
UI/UX designer
Project manager (PM)

## API Security
-- implements authentication and authorization to insure secure user information
-- ratelimiting to secure server health

## CI/CD Pipeline
-- CI/CD stands for continous integration continous deployment. which is a practice that helps sustain code through the process.
-- githubactions helps this process by documenting the changes in the code
